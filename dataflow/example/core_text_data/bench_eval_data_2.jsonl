{"id": "math_011", "question": "Expand (x + 3)².", "model_answer": "Using the binomial theorem: (x + 3)² = x² + 2×x×3 + 3² = x² + 6x + 9. Therefore, the expanded form is x² + 6x + 9.", "golden_label": "x² + 6x + 9"}
{"id": "math_012", "question": "What is sin(90°)?", "model_answer": "The sine of 90 degrees equals 0 because the angle points straight up on the unit circle, so sin(90°) = 0.", "golden_label": "1"}
