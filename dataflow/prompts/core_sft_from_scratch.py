Your mission is to generate diverse, realistic, and instruction-following training samples that will help models become more helpful, accurate, and aligned with human preferences.

## Core Principles:

**1. Structural Excellence:**
- instruction: Clear, specific, and actionable user request
- input: Contextual information when relevant (empty string if none needed)
- output: Comprehensive, accurate, and genuinely helpful response
- domain: Single domain classification from the provided taxonomy

**2. Quality Standards:**
- Responses must be factually accurate and demonstrate expertise
- Use natural, conversational language appropriate to the context
- Provide complete solutions that fully address the instruction
- Maintain consistency between instruction complexity and response depth
- Include relevant examples, explanations, or step-by-step guidance when beneficial

**3. Diversity Requirements:**
- Vary instruction phrasing and complexity levels
- Mix different user personas and contexts
- Include both simple and complex scenarios within each domain
- Generate instructions that reflect real-world use cases

**4. Safety & Ethics:**
- No harmful, illegal, discriminatory, or misleading content
- Respect privacy and avoid generating personal information
- Maintain neutrality on controversial topics
- Provide balanced perspectives when appropriate

**5. Technical Format:**
- Output valid JSON in a single line with no formatting
- Properly escape special characters in strings
- Ensure all required fields are present and correctly typed"""
        
        user_prompt = f"""Generate ONE premium-quality SFT training sample as a single-line JSON object.

## Requirements:
- **instruction**: A realistic user request that varies in style, complexity, and specificity
- **input**: Additional context when it enhances the scenario (otherwise empty string)
- **output**: A comprehensive, expert-level response that fully satisfies the instruction
- **domain**: Select the most appropriate domain from: {domain_keys}

## Quality Checklist:
✓ Instruction is clear and represents authentic user needs
✓ Response demonstrates expertise and provides genuine value
✓ Appropriate level of detail for the complexity of the request
✓ Natural, human-like language throughout
✓ Perfect JSON formatting in a single line

## Diversity Goals:
- Mix formal/informal language styles
- Include various difficulty levels and user contexts
- Represent different cultural perspectives when relevant
- Balance theoretical knowledge with practical applications

## Format Example:
{{"instruction": "Create a Python function that calculates compound interest with error handling", "input": "", "output": "def compound_interest(principal, rate, time, n=1):\\n    if principal <= 0 or rate < 0 or time < 0 or n <= 0:\\n        raise ValueError('Invalid input: principal must be positive, rate and time non-negative, n positive')\\n    return principal * (1 + rate/n)**(n*time)\\n\\n# Example usage:\\n# result = compound_interest(1000, 0.05, 2, 4)", "domain": "coding"}}

Output only the JSON - no explanations or additional text."""
