## Overview
DataFlow-Eval-Process is a data evaluation and processing system designed to evaluate data quality from multiple dimensions and filter out high-quality data. We mainly support SOTA algorithms within academic papers with strong theoretical support.

We now support text, image, video, and multimodality data types.

## News
- [2025-07-25] 🎉 We release the dataflow-agent.
- [2025-06-30] 🎉 We release the documentation of dataflow.
- [2025-05-30] 🎉 We added two data processing pipelines, i.e. knowledge base cleaning, and agentic rag data construction pipeline.
- [2025-04-30] 🎉 We added four data processing pipelines, i.e. text, code, nl2sql, and reasoning data pipeline.
- [2024-12-26] 🎉 Our first data evaluation and processing system is now open source.
- [2024-10-14] 🎉 We summarize data evaluation papers and codes in [👋 Awesome Data Evaluation](./Awesome_Data_Evaluation.md)
- [2024-10-14] 🎉 Our first data-centric evaluation system is now open source.
